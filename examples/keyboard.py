# Adafruit Raspberry Pi MPR121 Keyboard Example
# Author: Tony DiCola
#
# Allows you to turn touches detected by the MPR121 into key presses on a
# Raspberry Pi.
#
# NOTE: This only works with a Raspberry Pi right now because it depends on some
# specific event detection logic in the RPi.GPIO library.
#
# Dependencies
# ============
#
# Make sure you have the required dependencies by executing the following commands:
#   sudo apt-get update
#   sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-pip libudev-dev
#   sudo pip install python-uinput
#
# Also make sure you have installed the Adafruit Python MPR121 library by running
# its setup.py (in the parent directory):
#   sudo python setup.py install
#
# Usage
# =====
#
# To use this program you first need to connect the MPR121 board to the Raspberry
# Pi (either connect the HAT directly to the Pi, or wire the I2C pins SCL, SDA to
# the Pi SCL, SDA, VIN to Pi 3.3V, GND to Pi GND).  If you aren't using the HAT
# version of the board you must connect the IRQ pin to a free digital input on the
# Pi (the default is 26).
#
# Next define the mapping of capacitive touch input presses to keyboard
# button presses.  Scroll down to the KEY_MAPPING dictionary definition below
# and adjust the configuration as described in its comments.
#
# If you're using a differnet pin for the IRQ line change the IRQ_PIN variable
# below to the pin number you're using.  Don't change this if you're using the
# HAT version of the board as it's built to use pin 26 as the IRQ input.
#
# Finally run the script as root:
#   sudo python keyboard.py
#
# Try pressing buttons and you should see key presses made on the Pi!
#
# Press Ctrl-C to quit at any time.
